  I’m a big believer in the saying that you are the average of the five people
  you spend the most time with. Choose your partners thoughtfully.




  Growing up in Beijing and Hong Kong, I watched technology facilitate rapid
  economic development from WeChat as a new OS, to the electric bicycle
  revolution. Living in a state of constant change has made me crave continuous
  innovation.




  As a competitive swimmer, I learned early to never become complacent. When
  your main competition is the clock, you can always do better. I live by this
  philosophy.




  Today I’m excited about the future of social, marketplaces, commerce, voice
  computing, AR/VR, autonomous vehicles, and applied AI.




  Come chat with us - it’s never too early to start a conversation. We can’t
  wait to learn more about what makes you tick...
